# couldTheSticksMakeTriangle
This is a simple program build by C++ to check if the sticks could make a valid tringle.
<hr>
A triangle is valid if sum of its two sides is greater than the third side. If three sides are a, b and c, then three conditions should be met. 

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>1.a + b > c</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2.a + c > b</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>3.b + c > a</td>
  </tr>
</table>

# Preview
* First input value represent how much the test will run.
* Next input is how long each stick will check the validity to build a triangle (each test need three times input).
* Output for each test will return between "Yes" if they are valid or "No" if they are invalid.
* Done.
